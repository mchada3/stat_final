Welcome to our work in the **Car Price Prediction and Analysis project** to explore significant insights on pricing, value retention by brand, and trend of drive-type. We will answer several critical questions in the modern automotive market using statistical modeling supported by data-driven analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview

Cars are a big investment, and knowing the factors that drive their pricing and value retention is going to be very important to buyers, sellers, and car manufacturers. We analyze a comprehensive and cleaned dataset that will show trends and patterns of car prices and attributes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objectives

::: {style="display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start;"}
::: {style="flex: 2;"}
Our research focuses on answering the following questions:

**What determines the listed price of a car?**

Key variables for car price estimation include: mileage, brand, body type, kilometers driven, exterior color, and ownership history.

**How does mileage vary across different car brands and models?**

This analysis discusses the relation between car brand, its specific model, and the respective mileage performance of it; this can be quite important for the potential buyer and for a market analyst.

**Are there trends in drive types based on car brands or year of manufacture?**

We conduct analyses by various car brands and year of manufacture of the trends for such drive types as FWD, RWD, and AWD, all to the benefit of an in-depth insight into market trends and brand strategy.

## Methodology

-   **Data Cleaning**: We prepared a high-quality dataset by cleaning and organizing some variables such as `listed_price`, `OEM`, `body`, `km`, `exterior_color`, and `owner_type`.
-   **Statistical Modeling**: Strong methods of our predictive models are based on analyzing the relationships between attributes and prices of cars. •⁠ ⁠
-   **Visualization:** Interactive and static visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in our data.
