We will answer several critical questions in the modern automotive market using statistical modeling supported by data-driven analysis.\n\n\n\n\nCars are a big investment, and knowing the factors that drive their pricing and value retention is going to be very important to buyers, sellers, and car manufacturers. We analyze a comprehensive and cleaned dataset that will show trends and patterns of car prices and attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research focuses on answering the following questions:\nWhat determines the listed price of a car?\nKey variables for car price estimation include: mileage, brand, body type, kilometers driven, exterior color, and ownership history.\nHow does mileage vary across different car brands and models?\nThis analysis discusses the relation between car brand, its specific model, and the respective mileage performance of it; this can be quite important for the potential buyer and for a market analyst.\nAre there trends in drive types based on car brands or year of manufacture?\nWe conduct analyses by various car brands and year of manufacture of the trends for such drive types as FWD, RWD, and AWD, all to the benefit of an in-depth insight into market trends and brand strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCar Market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning: We prepared a high-quality dataset by cleaning and organizing some variables such as listed_price, OEM, body, km, exterior_color, and owner_type.\nStatistical Modeling: Strong methods of our predictive models are based on analyzing the relationships between attributes and prices of cars. •⁠ ⁠\nVisualization: Interactive and static visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData: Dive into our cleaned dataset and initial exploratory analysis.\nAnalysis: Discover the statistical models and methods used.\nResults: View insights from our research questions.\nAbout: Meet the team behind this project.\n\n\n\n© 2024 Car Price Prediction Project"

    "text": "Interpretation of Results\n\nPredicting Car Price:\nA linear regression model was trained using key features like Door, width, height, and fuel. The performance metrics of the model-very high accuracy and very low RMSE-promise that these basic car dimensions are strong predictors of Price. This infers that structural features play a major role in determining overall car Price.\nMileage Analysis:\nUsing descriptive statistics, including boxplots, to examine the distribution of mileage by brand. Economy brands had higher milages due to being in more frequent use, whereas higher-end brands showed a lesser mileage, reflecting good servicing or less usage.\nDrive Type Trends:\nA random forest classifier was run to study the relation among drive types, car brands, and years of manufacture. The model showed that FWD reached high popularity after the year 2015, when AWD and 4WD were still used on SUVs and more upmarket variants.\n\nAplications\n\n\nFor Purchasers:\nFor long-term value, those consumers should look toward brands with established reliability, such as Toyota and Honda, or models offering FWD for better fuel efficiency.\nPerformance-oriented buyers with an emphasis on versatility will most likely be attracted to AWD or 4WD configurations in SUVs.\nFor Manufacturers:\nAutomakers must commit to furthering technology with FWD to meet growing consumer demand for efficiency with economy.\nNiche markets may be captured by expanding product offerings in the AWD and 4WD sectors, particularly for SUVs and off-road enthusiasts.\nFor Dealerships:\nDealerships should therefore market high-demand models, either economy sedans for the practical buyer or SUVs from premium brands for the performance-over-economy consumer."
